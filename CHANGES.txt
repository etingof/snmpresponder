Revision 0.0.0, released 13-01-2019
-----------------------------------

- Initial public release

  As of this release, the SNMP Command Responder tool can run one or
  more SNMP agents and maintain one or more trees of MIB objects
  representing SNMP-managed entities. Received messages are applied
  onto one of the MIB trees chosen by tool's configuration.

  As of this initial version, the basic functionality seems to
  work, however:

  * the plugin feature is not fully implemented
  * GETNEXT/GETBULK performance needs to be improved
  * network transparency is not operational
  * the documentation is up, though still lacking at places
  * many imaginable configuration examples are not yet present
  * apparently, pysnmp 5.x API needs minor tweaks
  * unit tests is a highly desired thing
